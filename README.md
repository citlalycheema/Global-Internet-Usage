# Global-Internet-Usage

This is an example of a slide deck I created as part of a project for a Data Analysis course at American University in Spring 2023. The assignment asked us to find a dataset to highlight our data visualization skills using RMarkdown.

This presentation analyzes global internet usage and specifically looks at the relationship between internet use rate and urban rate. It further analyzes how income impacts internet use rate and urban rate. The data was downloaded from Kaggle, but it is orginally a Gapminder dataset. It includes data for 213 countries.

Files for the project:
  - `gapminder_internet.csv` replication data
  - `global_internet_usage. Rmd` code for creating the slides
  - `index.html` with the output
