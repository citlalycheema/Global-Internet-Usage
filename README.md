# Global-Internet-Usage

This is an example of a presentation I created for a Data Analysis course at American University during Spring 2023. The assignment was designed to highlight students' data visualization skills using RMarkdown.

This presentation analyzes global internet usage and specifically looks at the relationship between internet use rate and urban rate. It further analyzes how income impacts internet use rate and urban rate. The data was downloaded from Kaggle, but it is orginally a Gapminder dataset. It includes data for 213 countries.
