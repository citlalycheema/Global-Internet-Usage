# Motivation

Digital technology is a current "hot topic" for development

- There are over 5.16 billion internet users in the world.
- In last 12 months, internet users grew around 98 million and this number will continue to grow.
- However, there is still a huge "usage gap."

# Data

The data comes from a [GapMinder dataset](https://www.gapminder.org) and covers global internet usage.

- There are 213 observations. These observations are a list of 213 countries across 4 variables:

    - Country (unique identifier)
    - Income Per Person (GDP per capita in US $)
    - Internet Use Rate (People who have access to the worldwide network, rate is users per 100 people)
    - Urban Rate (People living in urban areas, rate is percentage of total population)
    
- Data did not specify whether this was mobile internet usage or what the predetermined conditions were.

# Relationship between Internet Use Rate and Urban Rate

.pull-left-1[
```{r fig1, out.width = '450px'}
  knitr::include_graphics('myplot.svg')
```
]
- The concentration of larger circles in the top right corner indicates that those who typically live in urban areas have a higher internet use rate.

---
# The Effect of Income Per Person on Internet Use Rate and Urban Rate

```{r fig2, out.width = '650px'}
  knitr::include_graphics('p3.svg')
```


- Income per person is positively correlated with urban rate.
- The higher the income, the more higher internet use rate.
